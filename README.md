# archimedes-principle
A simulation of Archimedes principle in 2D.

Rendered through a simple implementation of the GLUT library.
As the rendering engine is proprietary software by the University of Sk√∂vde I'm afraid I can't upload it here.
However, feel free to download the binaries: https://github.com/Tagglink/archimedes-principle/releases
