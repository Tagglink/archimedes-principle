# Game Physics Course
A collection of demos created as part of a course in Game Physics. 

Rendered through a simple implementation of the GLUT library.
As the rendering engine is proprietary software by the University of Sk√∂vde I'm afraid I can't upload it here.

However, feel free to download the binaries: https://github.com/Tagglink/game-physics-course/releases

## Using the binary
Right-click in the window to open up a menu that lets you switch between demos.
