# Game Physics Course
A collection of demos created as part of a course in Game Physics. 

As the rendering engine is proprietary software by the University of Sk√∂vde I'm afraid I can't upload it here.

However, feel free to download the binaries: https://github.com/Tagglink/game-physics-course/releases
(Win32 only, sadly! I probably won't get around to porting it to Linux; it's a school thing...)

## Using the binary
Right-click in the window to open up a menu that lets you switch between demos.
